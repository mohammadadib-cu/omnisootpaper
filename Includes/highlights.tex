	\begin{itemize}
		\item Omnisoot is a process modeling package that couples gas-phase chemistry with four inception models and two population balance models to describe soot and CB formation
		
		\item The balance between particle inception and surface growth determines the primary particle diameter of soot during hydrocarbon pyrolysis.
		
		\item Multiple combinations of inception and surface growth rates yield similar carbon mass predictions but lead to different soot morphologies..
		
		\item Only irreversible inception models reproduce the bimodal size distribution observed in ethylene pyrolysis within a flow reactor.
		
		\item When soot inception peaks upstream of the sampling location, distinct inception models can produce nearly identical particle size distributions.
