%\section{Analysis of the adjustment factor}
%Figure~\ref{fig:factors} shows the scatter of $\eta_{inc}$ and $\eta_{ads}$ for the studied cases. The corresponding numeric values are reported in Table~\ref{tab:optimizedfactors}. The data points obtained using KAUST for each inception model are overall lower than those obtained by Caltech because of the higher PAH production rates predicted using KAUST, which can be inferred from the higher maximum possible $f_v$ in Figure~\ref{fig:max_sootfv_chem}.
